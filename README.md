# Hi there! 👋

## About Me :grin:

👋 Hi there! I'm Rahul Nair, a computer science student at the University of Maryland, graduating in May 2025. I’m an aspiring software engineer with a passion for backend development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I love tackling complex problems and building impactful solutions. 

🎧 As an undergraduate researcher, I work with a cross-functional team to aggregate audio data from various environments at scale. I’m developing infrastructure that allows others in the industry to benchmark against our metrics, contributing to advancements in audio data processing and analytics. 

👔 I’m also part of the QUEST Honors Program, where I’m consulting with Capital I, a leader in Healthcare Technology Management solutions. Our team is working to improve their data quality by leveraging AI and ML, aiming to enhance their operational efficiencies and drive better decision-making.

✅ I recently built out several projects, focusing on AI-driven applications and leveraging the latest technologies. I’m always excited to explore new challenges, and I can't wait for what's next! Check out my projects below!


⚡ Fun fact: I'm the Tech Chair for Maryland Minza, a national dance competition on the DDN Circuit. I've been on the board for a couple years now, and I absolutely love it!
